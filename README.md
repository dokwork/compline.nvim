# feline-components

This plugin is an example of my own configuration of the
[feline.nvim](https://github.com/feline-nvim/feline.nvim). The main idea here
is creating separate reusable components and using them to describe the
configuration of the statusline.

## Motivation

I'm glad to use the Feline. This is the very powerful and useful plugin for
configuring the vim statusline. But for my taste, the final configuration
usually looks a little bit cumbersome and messy. I prefer to separate an
implementation of components and their composition. This plugin is a proof 
of concept of such idea.
